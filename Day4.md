*(Advent of Cyber 2025 – Day 04)*

---

## 📌 Overview

This room is part of **TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2025** and introduces the role of
**Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cyber Security**.  
The objective is to understand how AI is used across **defensive security,
offensive security, and secure software development**, along with the risks and
considerations involved in deploying AI-driven systems.

The room also includes a **hands-on AI showcase**, where an AI assistant guides
the user through practical security scenarios.

## 🧠 AI in Cyber Security – Key Concepts

### 🔹 Why AI in Cyber Security?

AI is increasingly used because it can:

| AI Capability | Cyber Security Application |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Large-scale data processing | Analysing logs, network traffic, and alerts |
| Behaviour analysis | Detecting anomalies and suspicious activity |
| Generative AI | Summarising incidents and providing context |

---

## 🛡 Defensive Security (Blue Team)

AI is widely adopted in defensive security to:

- Speed up **threat detection and investigation**
- Correlate telemetry from logs, endpoints, and networks
- Enhance **firewalls, IDS, and SIEM systems**
- Automate responses such as:
  - Isolating compromised hosts
  - Blocking malicious emails
  - Flagging abnormal logins in real time

AI acts as an **assistant**, not a replacement, improving analyst efficiency.

---

## ⚔ Offensive Security (Red Team)

In offensive security, AI helps automate repetitive tasks such as:

- Reconnaissance and OSINT gathering
- Parsing noisy scan results
- Mapping attack surfaces

This allows penetration testers to focus on **decision-making and exploitation**
that still require human expertise.

---

## 🧑‍💻 AI in Software Security

AI is also used in secure software development:

- Acting as a virtual collaborator during coding
- Performing **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**
- Performing **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**

⚠️ However, AI-generated code may introduce vulnerabilities, highlighting the
importance of **human review and secure coding practices**.

---

## ⚠️ Considerations & Risks of AI in Cyber Security

While powerful, AI is **not a silver bullet**. Key considerations include:

- AI outputs are **not always correct**
- Risk of overwhelming systems during offensive testing
- Data privacy and model security concerns
- Transparency and fairness of AI decisions
- Need for human validation and oversight

AI must be deployed **responsibly and ethically**, especially in production
environments.

---

## 🧪 Practical AI Showcase

The practical section involves interacting with **Van SolveIT**, an AI assistant,
to explore three real-world use cases:

### 🔴 Red Team
- Generate an exploit script
- Execute the exploit against a vulnerable web application

### 🔵 Blue Team
- Analyse web logs from an attack
- Identify suspicious behavior and indicators

### 🧑‍💻 Software Security
- Review source code
- Identify potential vulnerabilities using AI assistance

---

## 🚩 Flags Collected

| Task | Flag |
|----|-----|
| AI Showcase completion | `THM{AI_MANIA}` |
| SQL Injection exploit execution | `THM{SQLI_EXPLOIT}` |

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- AI enhances speed and efficiency in cyber security workflows
- AI supports, but does not replace, human expertise
- Both attackers and defenders can leverage AI
- Ethical use and validation of AI outputs are critical
- AI security is an emerging and rapidly evolving field

---

## 🔐 Security Takeaway

> AI is a powerful force multiplier in cyber security, but blind trust in AI
> outputs can introduce serious risks. Human oversight, validation, and ethical
> deployment remain essential.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This room provided a balanced introduction to **AI’s role in modern cyber
security**, combining theory with hands-on practice. It highlighted how AI can
assist across red team, blue team, and software security tasks, while reinforcing
the importance of **responsible and informed usage**.
